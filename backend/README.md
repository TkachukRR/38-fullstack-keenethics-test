# **Backend Part Description:**

The backend of the bicycle booking admin panel is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for effective code structuring and organization. Detailed description of components and functionality:

1. #### REST API:

- The backend provides a RESTful API for handling various operations related to bicycle management and statistics.
- Endpoints are designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for bicycles.

2. #### Database Integration:

- MongoDB is used as the database for storing and managing bicycle data.
- Each bicycle record is stored as a document in the MongoDB database collection, described by a schema that specifies data validation parameters before saving a bicycle.
- Integration ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of bicycle data.

3. #### Data Model and MVC Pattern:

- The MVC pattern is applied to separate the application logic into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.

4. #### Middleware for Validation:

- The backend includes middleware for validating form data before processing requests.
- Validation rules include mandatory presence of a minimum of 5 characters for text fields, accepting only numerical input for numerical fields, and ensuring all fields are mandatory.
- Specific validation checks ensure the uniqueness of bicycle IDs.

5. #### Calculation of Statistics:

- The backend performs calculations to generate statistics about bicycles.
- Statistics include the total number of bicycles, the number of available bicycles, the number of booked bicycles, and the average price.

6. #### Express Routing:

- Express routing is used to organize and handle incoming HTTP requests.
- Different routes are defined for various operations, such as adding, updating, deleting bicycles, and getting statistics.

7. #### Routing:

- Routes in Express are declared to handle requests: 
  - '/bikes/create', 
  - '/bikes/all', 
  - '/bikes/delete/:id', 
  - '/bikes/:id/status', 
  - '/bikes/stats'.

8. #### Controller:

- The bikeController contains logic to handle requests for each of the routes.
- Different controller methods, such as createBike, getAllBikes, removeBikeById, changeBikeStatus, and getBikesStats, handle corresponding requests.

9. #### Enumeration of Bicycle Status using ENUM.

10. #### Environment Configuration:

- The backend uses environment variables for configuration, including specifying the port number and MongoDB cluster connection details.
- The .env file stores these configuration parameters, ensuring security and flexibility in deployment.
